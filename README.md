Reflection:

I use rigorous testing and validation procedures to make sure my code, program, or software is secure and functioning. I convert requirements straight into unit tests and verify that every essential feature—including edge cases—functions as intended. In order to increase my trust in correctness, I additionally use code coverage techniques to make sure that most logic routes are being exercised. I strive for high coverage percentages. Coverage identifies untested areas so I can add more cases, but it does not ensure quality. In order to lower risks, I use secure coding techniques like input sanitization and safe error reporting in addition to functional testing, enforcing validation rules and handling exceptions in an understandable manner.

I approach requirements by decomposing them into user stories with explicit acceptance criteria in order to interpret user needs. I take extra care to address any potential ambiguities, such as how to enforce maximum string lengths or what constitutes a genuine phone number, and I include those explanations in the design and the tests. Every acceptance criterion is translated into a code behavior that is checked by a matching unit test. I make sure the program supports realistic scenarios and stops invalid activities, such making duplicate IDs or setting appointments in the past, by concentrating on end-user expectations.

Finding the primary domain objects and their limitations—such as Contacts, Tasks, and Appointments in this course—is the first step in my software design process. I create clear, testable interfaces that facilitate system extension while adhering to concepts like encapsulation and single responsibility to keep each class manageable and focused. Writing a test, implementing the simplest code to pass, and then reworking for clarity and efficiency while depending on the tests to prevent regressions is the iterative method I use, which is comparable to Red-Green-Refactor. This approach guarantees that the design develops gradually and continuously satisfies quality and functional requirements.
